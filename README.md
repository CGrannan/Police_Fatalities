## Introduction

Use of fatal force by police officers has garnered a lot of attention in recent years, and for good reason. Historically, statistics for victims of police shootings have not been representative of the population of the United States as a whole. For this project, I am going to take a dive into demographic statistics of victims of police shootings and compare them to the national population. I will be particularly looking for statistically different representations of race, age and gender and will be comparing these numbers at the national and state level. Additionally, I will be exploring the use of body cameras, presence of weapons, and presence of mental illness in shooting instances.

The data for this project comes from several sources. The primary datset that I will be using comes from [data.world](https://data.world/data-society/fatal-police-shootings) and contains descriptive features of shooting victims from 01/2015-01/2021. To increase the length of this study, I will be combining this data with another dataset from [data.world](https://data.world/awram/us-police-involved-fatalities) that lists police related fatalities from 2000-2016.

For data regarding state and national populations, I will be using a dataset from [KFF](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=4&selectedDistributions=white--black--hispanic--asian--american-indianalaska-native--native-hawaiianother-pacific-islander--total&selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D,%22states%22:%7B%22delaware%22:%7B%7D,%22ohio%22:%7B%7D,%22colorado%22:%7B%7D,%22california%22:%7B%7D,%22wisconsin%22:%7B%7D,%22north-carolina%22:%7B%7D,%22massachusetts%22:%7B%7D,%22alaska%22:%7B%7D,%22pennsylvania%22:%7B%7D,%22oklahoma%22:%7B%7D,%22texas%22:%7B%7D,%22new-jersey%22:%7B%7D,%22idaho%22:%7B%7D,%22nevada%22:%7B%7D,%22indiana%22:%7B%7D,%22florida%22:%7B%7D,%22maine%22:%7B%7D,%22kentucky%22:%7B%7D,%22district-of-columbia%22:%7B%7D,%22new-york%22:%7B%7D,%22arkansas%22:%7B%7D,%22utah%22:%7B%7D,%22connecticut%22:%7B%7D,%22vermont%22:%7B%7D,%22kansas%22:%7B%7D,%22north-dakota%22:%7B%7D,%22iowa%22:%7B%7D,%22maryland%22:%7B%7D,%22hawaii%22:%7B%7D,%22rhode-island%22:%7B%7D,%22montana%22:%7B%7D,%22south-dakota%22:%7B%7D,%22wyoming%22:%7B%7D,%22west-virginia%22:%7B%7D,%22missouri%22:%7B%7D,%22new-mexico%22:%7B%7D,%22oregon%22:%7B%7D,%22georgia%22:%7B%7D,%22virginia%22:%7B%7D,%22illinois%22:%7B%7D,%22alabama%22:%7B%7D,%22louisiana%22:%7B%7D,%22new-hampshire%22:%7B%7D,%22nebraska%22:%7B%7D,%22tennessee%22:%7B%7D,%22washington%22:%7B%7D,%22minnesota%22:%7B%7D,%22arizona%22:%7B%7D,%22south-carolina%22:%7B%7D,%22michigan%22:%7B%7D,%22mississippi%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) that contains population statistics for race in the U.S. in the US from 2015-2019.

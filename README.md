## Introduction

This is a project investigating police related fatalities in the US. The data that I am using came from [data.world](https://data.world/data-society/fatal-police-shootings). I will be looking at descriptive statistics of fatality victims to determine underlying patterns. As I explore the data and create models to evaluate descriptive features, I will update this README.
